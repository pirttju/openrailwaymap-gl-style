OpenRailwayMap GL Style using OpenMapTiles-Railway

[OpenRailwayMap](https://github.com/OpenRailwayMap/OpenRailwayMap) is an OpenStreetMap-based project for creating a detailled map of the world's railway infrastructure.

This repository contains OpenRailwayMap rendering styles rewritten as Mapbox GL styles for use with vector tiles. It is based on the vector tile schema of [OpenMapTiles-Railway](https://github.com/pirttju/openmaptiles-railway).
